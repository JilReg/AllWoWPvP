_Learn All PvP Relevant Spells of Every Class in World of Warcraft_

Hey PvPers!

As I’m working toward Gladiator, I felt there’s no way around learning all PvP-relevant spells of every class. To make this easier, I built a tool for myself. Hoping it can help others on their journey to Gladiator, I’ve turned it into a free and open-source website for the community to use.

## 🎯 What Is It?

[All WoW PvP](https://www.allwowpvp.com) is a website designed to help players:

- **🔍 Explore all PvP-relevant spells** for every class in one place.
- **🎯 Study spells efficiently** with interactive flashcards.

## 🌟️ Features

Everything you need to learn all spells efficiently:

- **📚 Spell Overview**: A complete breakdown of all PvP-relevant spells with icons, descriptions, and screenshots for easy learning and recognition.
- **🧠 Study Tool**: Interactive flashcards let you choose between icons or screenshots to practice recognizing spells until you know them in your sleep.
- **❤️ Completely Free**: Just a passion project built to help WoW PvPers succeed.

## 🤔 Who Is This For?

For PvP players of all skill levels:

- PvP newcomers who want to build their knowledge.
- Competitive players aiming to achieve Gladiator.

- 🛠️️ **Submit Pull Requests**: If you're a developer, feel free to contribute directly to the codebase.

Let’s work together to make PvP spell learning accessible and fun for the entire WoW community!

## 💪️ Features Over Fluff

Since almost all the code was quickly put together with the help of ChatGPT, it’s not exactly a masterpiece of optimization or readability—but hey, it works! Given the focused scope of the project, the code serves its purpose well enough for now. Rather than diving into heavy refactoring, contributions will have a bigger impact if they focus on enhancing functionality and adding awesome new features to make the site even better for the community.

Some features that would be nice to add in the future include assigning a class specs to each spell and providing information about whether two spells are mutually exclusive (i.e., a player can only have one of them).
